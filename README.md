# Tic-Tac-Toe
Console-based TicTacToe game written in Python, Unit-Tested with the "unittest" Python Framework

Tic Tac Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, column, or a diagonal with either three O’s or three “X’s drawn in the spaces of a 3x3 grid. Each player is assigned either an “X” marker or an “O” marker at the start of the game. Once a player completes either a row, column, or diagonal with three of their corresponding markers in a row, that player wins the game. If the entire 3x3 grid is filled without a win, the game is concluded as a draw. 

To play, simply run the TicTacToe.py file and respond as directed in output window.

Format to enter board marker coordinates is "row#" space "column#"
